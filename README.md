Dataset
The dataset consists of customer details such as tenure, service usage, and customer support interactions.

Models
XGBoost: Used for boosting performance on imbalanced datasets.
Random Forest: A classical ensemble method for classification.
Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook (CustomerChurnPrediction_telecom.ipynb) to train and evaluate models.
